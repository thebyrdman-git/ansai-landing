# Netlify configuration for Ansai Landing + Docs
# 
# This repo serves BOTH:
# - ansai.dev (landing page) - uses publish = "."
# - docs.ansai.dev (documentation) - uses publish = "site"
#
# You need TWO Netlify sites pointing to this repo with different configs

[build]
  # For ansai.dev (landing page) - no build needed, just serve static HTML
  command = "echo 'Serving landing page - no build needed'"
  publish = "."  # Serve index.html from root

# For docs.ansai.dev, configure a SECOND Netlify site with:
# - Repository: thebyrdman-git/ansai-landing
# - Build command: pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-print-site-plugin && python -m mkdocs build
# - Publish directory: site
